# Mapping Earthquakes

## Project Overview

This project uses JavaScript, Leaflet and D3 to display earthquake data available from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)
// Data From: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php

## Project Documentation

The map created for this project displays data in four different layers. All four layers are turned on by default which leads to a very busy screen. It is recommended that the user use the controls located in the top right-hand side of the window.
